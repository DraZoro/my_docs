This is used to keep my notes in one place. `Sphinx`_ is used to build the
documentation. 

Building the documentation steps.

.. code:: bash 

   sudo pip install sphinx 
   sudo pip install sphinx-autobuild 
   # Then within the root of the documentation run
   sphinx-autobuild . _build_html

.. Web sites
.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org
